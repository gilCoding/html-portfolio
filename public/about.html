<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I just love to sing and write songs, record songs and put the full band production on the songs. My house is full of instruments, so whenever musicians come visit we can jam and have fun. I also worked at Sony publishing helping new talent. I have written three novels that has not yet been published. I love to talk about life and health and get plenty of ideas all the time.</p>

<p>Because of all the programming music, and being a tech support guy at a big phone company, I started being interested in webdevelopment and programming. My dream is to become a programmer and combining this with my music.</p>

<p>I have two grown up kids. One works in tech and sales and the other studies to become a journnalist. </p>
